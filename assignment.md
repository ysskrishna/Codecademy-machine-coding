b. Support searching on a few attributes.
c. Support advanced filtering and sorting.
 
Additional Requirements
You must:
· Use accurate HTTP response codes and handle errors.
· Provide API documentation.
· Write basic tests for your code.
Suggestions
To impress, consider:
· Dockerizing your application
Others:
· This round will be immediately followed by a live discussion on the project with a Codecademy engineer.
·
· You should be able to demonstrate the solution running locally on your machine. Using an online IDE is not permitted.
· Share the repo through Github with the engineer for review post the discussion mandatorily.
· Add some basic documentation steps to test the endpoints in the README
· Feel free to use any tools or IDEs of your choice and implement it using any tech stack and/or libraries – be open about your choices and implementation decisions and usage of tools
· Feel free to take decisions on anything that you might have questions or are uncertain about – remember you get a chance to discuss and if required defend your choices in the review
